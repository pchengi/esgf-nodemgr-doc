Esgf Node Manager the prototype

This prototype serves to evaluate several of the distributed systems concepts prescribed for the design of the 2015-gen ESGF node manager.

Prerequisites:  Python 2.7 installation.  Django installation.  easy_install will install django for you.

Setup:

Set several environment variables

export ESGF_NODEMGR_MAP="<your nodemap file>"
export ESGF_NM_TASKS="<directory to hold tasks>"
export ESGF_NM_TIMESTAMP="<file to write timestamp>"


run "python gen_nodemap.py node1.domain.org node2.other.gov node3 ... "
to generate an initial map file at the location set in the environment variable.

Use "uname -a" to retrieve hostname information for each node name.  The name should be fully-qualified if thats what is reported, or not if that's the case.

###  for manual editing: Node Map examples are found in conf_examples.  Fill out entries for supernodes. and have n*(n-1)/2 entries for links. 


run_server.sh will start django (in foreground) and the node manager main process (in background).

Alternatively, you can run the django process and basic_nodemanager.py processes in separate windows, but must start with following:

django:  

  

node manager process:

  python 


Utilities:

member_node_cmd.py when run on a member node lets you add/remove the node from the federation. The node manager must be running on that node.

add_supernode.py can be used to add additional supernode entries and associated link entries.
