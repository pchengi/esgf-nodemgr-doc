Esgf Node Manager the prototype

Prerequisites:  Python 2.7 installation.  Django installation.  easy_install will install django for you.

Setup:

To date, a single environment variable is needed in addition to Python 2.7+.X + Django:

export ESGF_NODEMGR_MAP="<your nodemap file>"

Node Map examples are found in conf_examples.  Fill out entries for supernodes. and have n*(n-1)/2 entries for links. 


run_server.sh will start django (in foreground) and the node manager main process (in background).

Utilities:

member_node_cmd.py when run on a member node lets you add/remove the node from the federation. the node manager must be running on that node.

add_supernode.py is meant to run offline to add a supernode entry to a conf file.  The script takes care of adding th
