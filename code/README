Esgf Node Manager the prototype

This prototype serves to evaluate several of the distributed systems concepts prescribed for the design of the 2015-gen ESGF node manager.

Prerequisites:  
  * Python 2.7.9 installation.  
  * Django (1.8)  
  * sqlalchemy (1.0.9)
  * psycopg2 (2.6.1)

Setup:

Set several environment variables:

export ESGF_NODEMGR_MAP="<your nodemap file>"
export ESGF_NM_TASKS="<directory to hold tasks>"
export ESGF_NM_TIMESTAMP="<file to write timestamp>"
export ESGF_NM_PORT=6720

  -- or --

Edit and source ./conf_examples/nm.env

For the node map file you can 

If you don't have ESGF installed you need to set up basic files that
come with the installer.

  sudo mkdir -p /esg/config
  sudo mkdir -p /esg/log
  echo 0 > /esg/config/config_type 
  cp code/conf_examples/esgf.properties /esg/config/
  sed -i s/'pcmdi11\.llnl\.gov'/`hostname`/g /esg/config/esgf.properties
    **  other properties elements need to be edited by hand


If you used the nm.env defaults, make sure they are present:

cp code/conf_examples/node-mgr-repo.json.org /esg/config/node-mgr-repo.json
mkdir /esg/tasks


run "python gen_nodemap.py node1.domain.org node2.other.gov node3 ... "
to generate an initial map file at the location set in the environment variable.

Use "uname -a" to retrieve hostname information for each node name.  The name should be fully-qualified if thats what is reported, or not if that's the case.

###  for manual editing: Node Map examples are found in conf_examples.  Fill out entries for supernodes. and have n*(n-1)/2 entries for links. 


run_server.sh will start django (in foreground) and the node manager main process (in background).  Both need to be running.  

Alternatively, you can run the django process and basic_nodemanager.py processes in separate windows, but must start with following:

django:  

server/nodemgr/manage.py runserver <host-mask:port>  [eg. 0.0.0.0:80]

node manager process:

  python server/basic_nodemanager.py <map-file> <timestamp-file>


1) Start up the node manager on supernodes #2-N (where N is total supernodes) first.
2) Start up on supernode #1.  It will bootstrap the health check by capturing and deploying the timestamp that all nodes will use (assumes ntp)

3) Start up member nodes.  use command below to contact a supernode and add to federation

Next see below to start adding member nodes.

Utilities:

member_node_cmd.py when run on a member node lets you add/remove the node from the federation. The node manager must be running on that node.  Use node name from "uname -a"

add_supernode.py can be used to add additional supernode entries and associated link entries.
